            <h2>Scenario</h2>
            <p>
                A team is developing a travel guide website aimed at providing comprehensive information about various tourist destinations. The project involves creating a <span class="terminology">responsive design</span> to ensure the website is accessible on multiple devices, implementing <span class="terminology">CSS Grid</span> and <span class="terminology">Flexbox</span> for layout, and using both <span class="terminology">external stylesheets</span> and <span class="terminology">internal stylesheets</span> to manage styles. The team also creates a <span class="terminology">content map</span> or <span class="terminology">wireframe</span> to plan the website structure.

            <h2>Problem 1: Inconsistent Layout Across Devices</h2>
            <p>
                One issue the team encounters is that the website layout appears inconsistent across different devices, with elements overlapping or not aligning properly. This problem arises due to the improper use of <span class="terminology">CSS Grid</span> and <span class="terminology">Flexbox</span> properties, which are crucial for creating a <span class="terminology">responsive design</span>.
            </p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
                To resolve this, the team conducts a thorough review of their CSS code, ensuring that <span class="terminology">media queries</span> are correctly implemented to adjust the layout for various screen sizes. They utilize <span class="terminology">CSS Grid</span> for the overall page structure and <span class="terminology">Flexbox</span> for aligning items within grid areas. By carefully applying these properties and testing across different devices, the team ensures a consistent and responsive layout.

            <h2>Problem 2: Styling Conflicts</h2>
            <p>
                Another issue is the occurrence of styling conflicts between <span class="terminology">external stylesheets</span> and <span class="terminology">internal stylesheets</span>. Some styles defined in the internal stylesheets are overriding those in the external stylesheets, leading to unexpected visual results.
            </p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
                The team decides to streamline their stylesheet management by consolidating most of the styles into <span class="terminology">external stylesheets</span>, leaving only critical page-specific styles in <span class="terminology">internal stylesheets</span>. They also establish a clear hierarchy and specificity in their CSS rules to avoid conflicts. By doing so, they achieve a more organized and maintainable stylesheet structure, eliminating styling conflicts.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="terminology">Responsive design</span>: An approach to web design that ensures a website looks and works well on various devices and screen sizes.</li>
                <li><span class="terminology">CSS Grid</span>: A CSS layout method used for creating complex and responsive grid-based layouts.</li>
                <li><span class="terminology">Flexbox</span>: A CSS layout model that allows for responsive alignment and distribution of elements within a container.</li>
                <li><span class="terminology">Content map</span> or <span class="terminology">wireframe</span>: A visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.</li>
                <li><span class="terminology">External stylesheets</span>: CSS files that are linked to an HTML document from an external file.</li>
                <li><span class="terminology">Internal stylesheets</span>: CSS rules defined within the HTML document itself, typically within the &lt;style&gt; tag.</li>
                <li><span class="terminology">Block elements</span>: HTML elements that start on a new line and take up the full width available (e.g., &lt;div&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;).</li>
                <li><span class="terminology">Inline elements</span>: HTML elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary (e.g., &lt;span&gt;, &lt;a&gt;).</li>
            </ul>
